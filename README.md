"Results" contains all CSV outputs for each model pair (one example and then all 30 conversations for each)
Also contains the aggregated results shown in the paper

"Fine-Tuning" contains the code used to fine-tune the models on different datasets. I only wrote the data preparation, not the fine-tuning logic

"Final Report, Presentations, and Proposal" contains the report, both presentations, and the proposal, all as pdfs

"GenerateConversation" is the main code for the project, used to generate all the conversations and fine-tune the generation

"e_diff_measurement_scores" is some extra code used for arguing the efficacy of the metrics
